2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock pynqz2_dpu_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock pynqz2_dpu_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin pynqz2_dpu_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-46#1 Warning
Multicycle path with tied CE pins  
One or more multicycle paths are defined between registers pynqz2_dpu_i/dpu_eu_0/inst/g_e584eb07.u_822a997b/u_8329ce29/u_3aa346a2/u_dcd815c9/u_6c52c68e/u_870191c1/s_7c8ae0ce_reg/Q and pynqz2_dpu_i/dpu_eu_0/inst/g_e584eb07.u_822a997b/u_8329ce29/u_3aa346a2/u_dcd815c9/u_6c52c68e/u_870191c1/s_81ad3443_reg/D with a direct connection and the CE pins connected to VCC (see constraint position 11 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).  This may result in an inaccurate path requirement.
Related violations: <none>

ULMTCS-1#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 1568 control sets (vs. available limit of 13300, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.
Related violations: <none>
